- Hello, My name is Ctr+Alt+Chase, but you can call me 'Chase'

- I'm a high school graduate who really loves to make music, watch anime, play video games, and more, but above all, I love to code!

- On the subject of learning to code and just learning how different coding languages work, I've always found Game Development interesting and would love to give it a go when my coding skill gets better.

- As far as music, I really love EDM (Dubstep, Electro House, Psytrance and more.), but I will listen to the classic stuff (Rock, Alternative Rock, Metal and more.) on occasion.

- The video games I play are mainly rhythm games (stemming from my love for music), but I do play FPS Games, such as Call of Duty, from time to time.

- On the watching anime side of things, I love slice of life, but I love psychological horror just as much. Psychological Horror titles I love include Future Diary, Higurashi, Danganronpa, and more.
